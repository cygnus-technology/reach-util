# Reach Utilities

## Overview
This repository is intended to contain smaller non-essential utilities developed for Reach projects.  Currently, it only contains Python scripts written to simplify the process of setting up services for Reach devices with firmware written in C.  See the `README.md` file in the `c-gen` folder for details on this utility.  Eventually, this repository may contain other projects.
